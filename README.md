# Nmap-Scanner-Project-First-Step


In this project i will be creating the first steps for my Nmap scanner, this first step will have a simple python code that will use ip addresses, scan it and print out the wanted output, this as a first step its not much different than using an nmap scanner inside a VM.

Bare in mind that this code is supposed to be run on a VM eviroment, using this in a normal env will most likly result in an error message, be advised that to run this code you will need the right root permition in your system.
